# The Ultimate OpenClaw Setup Guide 🚀

> This guide outlines a production-ready, multi-agent OpenClaw environment. It covers everything from the server setup to advanced multi-channel configuration.

---

## 1. 🏗️ Infrastructure Foundation
For maximum flexibility and power, run OpenClaw on a dedicated Linux environment (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended).

- **Hosting:** AWS EC2 (t3.medium or larger) recommended for a stable, always-on home.
- **Node.js:** OpenClaw runs on Node. Ensure you have the latest LTS version (`v22+`).
- **File Structure:**
  ```text
  /home/ubuntu/
  ├── .openclaw/
  │   ├── openclaw.json       # The Brain (Core Config)
  │   ├── workspace/          # The Heart (SOUL.md, USER.md, AGENTS.md)
  │   │   ├── memory/         # Daily logs and state files
  │   │   └── skills/         # Custom tools and scripts
  │   └── agents/             # Specialized Agent workspaces
  │       └── specialized-agent/
  │           ├── SOUL.md
  │           └── USER.md
  ├── dropbox/                # (Optional) For Obsidian sync
  └── apps/                   # Custom web apps managed by the AI
  ```

## 2. 🧠 The Brain: `openclaw.json` (Example)
This is the core configuration. It defines your models, channels, and how the AI interacts with the world.

```json
{
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "anthropic": {
        "apiKey": "sk-ant-...",
        "api": "anthropic-messages"
      },
      "openai": {
        "apiKey": "sk-proj-...",
        "api": "openai-responses"
      }
    }
  },
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "accounts": {
        "main-bot": {
          "botToken": "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
          "enabled": true
        }
      }
    },
    "telegram": {
      "accounts": {
        "mobile-bot": {
          "botToken": "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN",
          "enabled": true
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "list": [
      {
        "id": "main",
        "default": true,
        "model": { "primary": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6" }
      },
      {
        "id": "finance-bot",
        "workspace": "/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/agents/finance",
        "model": { "primary": "google-gemini-cli/gemini-3-flash-preview" }
      }
    ]
  },
  "bindings": [
    {
      "agentId": "main",
      "match": { "channel": "discord", "accountId": "main-bot" }
    },
    {
      "agentId": "finance-bot",
      "match": { "channel": "telegram", "accountId": "mobile-bot" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 3. 🧬 The Soul & Identity
OpenClaw is "context-driven." It looks at files in its workspace to figure out who it is.

- **`SOUL.md`:** The AI's moral compass and personality.
- **`USER.md`:** Information about you (preferences, goals, schedules).
- **`AGENTS.md`:** Internal instructions for the AI on how to handle memory and tools.

---

## 4. 🛡️ Multi-Agent Architecture
Separate concerns for better security and focus.

- **Main Agent:** System commands, coding, and general "Heavy Lifting."
- **Specialized Agents:** Create agents with their own `SOUL.md` and `USER.md` to focus on specific domains (e.g., Finance, Research, or Health).

---

## 5. 🚑 Disaster Recovery & Automation
- **S3 Backups:** Use a cron job to sync the `.openclaw` directory to an S3 bucket every few hours.
- **Git Mirroring:** Use multiple remotes (`gitlab` and `github`) to keep your code redundant.
- **Systemd:** Run OpenClaw as a service so it auto-starts on boot.

```ini
# Example openclaw.service
[Unit]
Description=OpenClaw Gateway
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ubuntu
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu
ExecStart=/usr/bin/openclaw gateway start
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
