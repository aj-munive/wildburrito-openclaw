# The Ultimate OpenClaw Setup Guide 🚀

> A production-ready blueprint for a multi-agent, multi-channel OpenClaw environment.

---

## 1. 🏗️ Infrastructure & File Structure
OpenClaw is a Node.js-based autonomous agent system. It works best on a stable, always-on environment like an AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu 22.04+).

### Core Directory Structure:
```text
/home/ubuntu/
├── .openclaw/              # Hidden config directory
│   ├── openclaw.json       # THE BRAIN: API keys, bots, and agent logic
│   ├── workspace/          # THE HEART: Root agent personality and data
│   │   ├── SOUL.md         # Defining WHO the AI is
│   │   ├── USER.md         # Defining WHO you are
│   │   ├── MEMORY.md       # Long-term curated memories
│   │   ├── memory/         # Daily session logs (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
│   │   └── skills/         # Custom scripts/tools (e.g., weather, obsidian)
│   └── agents/             # THE ORG: Sub-agent workspaces
│       └── equitas/        # Example specialized agent
│           ├── SOUL.md     # Auditor personality
│           └── USER.md     # Financial context only
└── backup-to-s3.sh         # Redundancy script
```

## 2. 🧠 The Configuration: `openclaw.json`
This file is the single source of truth for your ecosystem.

```json
{
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "anthropic": {
        "apiKey": "sk-ant-...",
        "api": "anthropic-messages"
      }
    }
  },
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "accounts": {
        "primary": {
          "botToken": "DISCORD_TOKEN",
          "enabled": true
        }
      }
    },
    "telegram": {
      "accounts": {
        "mobile": {
          "botToken": "TELEGRAM_TOKEN",
          "enabled": true
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "list": [
      {
        "id": "main",
        "default": true,
        "model": { "primary": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6" }
      },
      {
        "id": "equitas",
        "workspace": "/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/agents/equitas",
        "model": { "primary": "google-gemini-cli/gemini-3-flash-preview" }
      }
    ]
  },
  "bindings": [
    {
      "agentId": "main",
      "match": { "channel": "discord", "accountId": "primary" }
    },
    {
      "agentId": "equitas",
      "match": { "channel": "telegram", "accountId": "mobile" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 3. ⌨️ Essential OpenClaw CLI Commands
Once installed, you interact with the system using the `openclaw` command.

### Gateway Management (The Daemon)
- `openclaw gateway status`  - Check if the system is running.
- `openclaw gateway start`   - Start the background process.
- `openclaw gateway stop`    - Kill the process.
- `openclaw gateway restart` - Apply changes made to `openclaw.json`.

### Session Control (Inside the Chat)
- `/status`    - See current token usage, model, and context window size.
- `/reasoning` - Toggle "Thinking" mode on/off (if the model supports it).
- `/compact`   - Manually flush the context window to save tokens.

---

## 4. 🧬 Personalizing the Agent
The agent reads these files at the start of **every** session.

- **SOUL.md:** Define the vibe. Use this to set "Core Truths" (e.g., "Be resourceul before asking questions").
- **USER.md:** Give it your context. Timezone, goals, and recurring tasks. 
- **Pro-Tip:** If you have multiple agents, keep their `USER.md` files specific. Don't tell your Finance agent about your gym habits, or he'll start nagging you to lift when he should be auditing receipts.

---

## 5. 🛡️ Security & Redundancy
- **AWS Security Groups:** Keep ports 22 (SSH), 80, and 443 restricted to your **Home IP** only.
- **S3 Sync:** Set up a crontab to run a sync script every 6 hours:
  ```bash
  aws s3 sync ~/.openclaw/workspace s3://your-bucket-name/backup/
  ```
- **Git Mirroring:** Use `git remote add mirror <url>` to push your workspace to both GitLab and GitHub.
